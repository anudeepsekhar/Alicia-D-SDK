Demo: Set new zero configuration

Warning: 
- Ensure no obstacles around the robot arm before calibration
- When torque is disabled, manually support the robot arm
- 一旦设置新零点，无法恢复至出厂零点！！！！如果想恢复需购买标定工具！！！
    Once the new zero point is set, it CANNOT be restored to the factory zero point! 
    If you want to restore it, you need to purchase the calibration tool!
